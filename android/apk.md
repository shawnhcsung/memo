# Android Package

## Android Studio

### Build Variants

Click **Build > Select Build Variant** from the menu bar at the top, or **Build Variants** from the panel at the left side.

## Reverse Engineering

We can use [Apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) to decode APK to nearly original form.

```bash
apktool d ${name}.apk
```
