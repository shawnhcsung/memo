# Getting Started

## Building Demo Source

Download the source code from [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS):

```
git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git
```

Follow the instruction [here](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-simulator-for-Linux.html) to build the simulator demo on Linux:

```
cd FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/Posix_GCC
make
```

You will get the following error:

```
main_full.c:77:10: fatal error: FreeRTOS.h: No such file or directory
   77 | #include <FreeRTOS.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
make: *** [Makefile:79: build/main_full.o] Error 1
```

By reading [Repository structure](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS#repository-structure) carefully, you'll find this:

> FreeRTOS/Source contains the FreeRTOS kernel source code (submoduled from https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel).

So we have to download the kernel as well, and extract it to `FreeRTOS/Source`. After all, you should be able to build the demo source into the `build` directory now:

```
$ ls -l
total 144
-rw-rw-r-- 1   148 FreeRTOS-simulator-for-Linux.url
-rw-rw-r-- 1  7990 FreeRTOSConfig.h

drwxrwxr-x 3   304 build

-rw-rw-r-- 1  1604 console.h
-rw-rw-r-- 1 14721 main.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 11014 main_blinky.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 30759 main_full.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1  2400 run-time-stats-utils.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 14039 trcConfig.h
-rw-rw-r-- 1 17696 trcSnapshotConfig.h
```

Run `./build/posix_demo`:

```
Trace started.
The trace will be dumped to disk if a call to configASSERT() fails.

The trace will be dumped to disk if Enter is hit.

### Multitasking

A piece of code (instructions) for a particular function can be regarded as a task to operating sã„‹ystem.

Operating systems should be capable of running multiple tasks seemingly simultaneously even on a platform with single-core CPU.

For this purpose, the following concepts are introduced:

- Memory management
  - Heap
- Task management
- Queue management

- Scheduling
  - Task priorities
  - Task states
  - Co-routine priorities
  - Co-routine states
- Context Switching
