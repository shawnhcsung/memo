Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:

    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right,
for example, 2=II, 12=XII, 27=XXVII
However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.
Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Examples:

    Input: 3, Output: III
    Input: 4, Output: IV
    Input: 9, Output: IX
    Input: 58, Output: LVIII
    Input: 1994, Output: MCMXCIV

Constraints: 1 <= num <= 3999
